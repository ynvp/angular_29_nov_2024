Use Strict
==========
-provides better coding standard and stronger error checking.
-'use strict' is only recognized at the beginning of a script or a function.
-JavaScript modules are automatically in strict mode, with no statement needed to initiate it.(import/export)
-The purpose of "use strict" is to execute the javascript in "strict mode".
-when 'use strict' is not written, browser runs the JS in normal mode.
-when 'use strict' is  written, browser runs the JS in strict mode.
-in Normal mode few mistakes are ignored, in strict mode mistakes are not ignored


1. variable declaration without var/let/const is not allowed.
   makes it impossible to accidentally create global variables.
2. function with duplicate arguements are not allowed.
3. NaN/undefined/Infinity cann't be used as a variable name.
4. Delete of an unqualified identifier in strict mode. 
    ex:delete Object.prototype; 
	var x = 5; delete x;
5. Multiple assignments not allowed.
   var a = b = c = 3;
6. 'this' is undefined, when a function is invoked from Global Context in strict mode.


functions
=========
1. Pre-Defined / inbuilt
  javascript inbuilt objects : console , document , window , Math , Array , Object
  console Object Methods : log() , table(), warn() , error() , time() , timeEnd()
  document Object Methods : write() , writeln()
  window Object methods : alert() , prompt() , confirm() , print(), close(), atob() , btoa()
  Math : max() , min(), sqrt(), cbrt()
2. User Defined
   a. Function declaration
   b. Function Expression
   c. Self invoked / IIFE - Immediately Invoked Function Expression
   d. Arrow Function (ES-6) (2015)


How 'this' works in arrow function & regular function
=====================================================
regular : 'this' is calculated , how/where the function is invoked
           'this' is dynamic
arrow : 'this' is not calculated how  the function is invoked,
        'this' is decided from the place, where the arrow function is written
        'this' is not dynamic


Arrow function Limitations
==========================
1. arrow functions shouldn't used as object methods. dont use arrow functions inside objects
2. Don't use arrow function if 'this' should be dynamic inside a function


Assignments:
1. using prompt collect 2 values from user and perform all arithmetic operations on those 2 values
